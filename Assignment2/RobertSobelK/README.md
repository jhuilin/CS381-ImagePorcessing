# Using python to apply Robert, Sobel and Lapalce derivative on image

## input an target image
![Image of launch app](./desktop.jpg)

## apply Robert
![Image of launch app](./robert.jpg)

## apply Sobel
![Image of launch app](./sobel.jpg)

## apply Laplace, this is second derivative
![Image of launch app](./laplace.jpg)

## as we can see above, the output image of Robert is the most dark one, the output image of Sobel is the most lighter one, and the output of laplace is in middle.

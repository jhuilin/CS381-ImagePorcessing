# Using python to apply equalization on Images

## The concept is read image from local file and transform it to gray image if its a color image.
## then we apply pre-define equalization method to transform the image and save it to the local file.
### finally, we display original image histogram and the histogram images that have been equalizing.

## input an overexposure image
![Image of launch app](./over.jpg)

## input another underexposure image
![Image of launch app](./under.jpg)

## output of overexposure image after equalization
![Image of launch app](./equ_over.jpg)

## output of underexposure image after equalization
![Image of launch app](./equ_under.jpg)

## histogram of 4 images
### blue: original overexposure image
### orange: original underexposure image
### green: overexposure image after equalization
## red: underexposure image after equalization
![Image of launch app](./histogram.jpg)

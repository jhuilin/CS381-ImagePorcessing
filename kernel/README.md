# Using python to apply exact histogram matching

## input an target image
![Image of launch app](./target.jpg)

## input an reference image
![Image of launch app](./reference.jpg)

## output a result image after matching
![Image of launch app](./result.jpg)

## as we can see above target image is the darkest one, reference image is the most exposure one, and the level of light of the result image is in middle of two images.
